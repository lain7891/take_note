# take_note

For this assignment we used an express backend and saved and retrieved the note data from a JSON file. We had to create an application that would write, save and delete notes. This is a great application for users to keep track of reminders, keep lists and be able to delete them when they are finished with it.

As a user, I want to be able to write and save notes. I want to be able to delete notes that I’ve written before so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.
